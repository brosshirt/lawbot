# lawbot

Law students use the lawbot to consult their notes. 

So we're done with the chatbot, now it's a search tool. Basically you ask a question and you click on the relevant chunk that you'd like to see in context. Then, on the right side of the screen, you can see the chunk you clicked on highlighted in context, as if you had ctrl-fed it.  

## Current State

It's a working version, I want to see if Nick is going to complain about something and then figure out what to do from there. Eventually we should probably get rid of this pdftron api.

## Current task

1. Get feedback

## Backlog

1. Fix potential bugs with the ctrl-f issue, like if the chunk has 1 character on one page and 699 characters on the other
2. Abandon the pdf api
