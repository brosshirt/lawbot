## Current State

MVP is done. We just need to clean up the project and then we can figure out how to get it in nick's hands.

## Current task

1. Clean up the backend
    - Need to find a place to put all of these util functions for the backend, app.py should be clean I think
    - I want consistent naming across my front and backend. Extremely consistent
    - I hate all those import statements at the top of my file, there's gotta be a way to simplify that
    - I'm not sure but I think I'd like to make a config file that contains the system prompt and the k and stuff that's separate from the code
