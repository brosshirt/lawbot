# lawbot

Law students use the lawbot to consult their notes. 

So we're done with the chatbot, now it's a search tool. Basically you ask a question and you click on the relevant chunk that you'd like to see in context. Then, on the right side of the screen, you can see the chunk you clicked on highlighted in context, as if you had ctrl-fed it.  

## Current State

You can search the notes for something, click on the chunks, and then see that chunk in context.

The PDF API is not great, I probably would've saved time had I just made a custom solution. It's a good exercise though.

## Current task

1. Disable the toolbar permanently
2. Add the functionality to change the width of the two halves
3. Change the zoom default, it's too zoomed out
