# lawbot

Law students use the lawbot to consult their notes. 

So we're done with the chatbot, now it's a search tool. Basically you ask a question and you click on the relevant chunk that you'd like to see in context. Then, on the right side of the screen, you can see the chunk you clicked on highlighted in context, as if you had ctrl-fed it.  

## Current State

The left side of the screen is done, more or less. 

The next step is to build the right side of the screen, which is just going to be a text editor that displays a word document and has the capability of ctrl-fing. 

## Current task

The screen should have a left and right side, when you click on one of the chunks it should display the chunk you clicked on on the left side.
