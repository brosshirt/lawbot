# lawbot

Law students use the lawbot to consult their notes. 

## Current State

We have a basic version of the application that answers questions about the law school notes. The code is messy, the prompt is probably suboptimal, and the response needs to be displayed much better, it should include the articles. We have an MVP, we just need to decide what the MVP that we show to Nick is going to be and then host it and get some feedback.

## Current task

1. Clean up the code/project
2. Modify the prompt a little bit, like spend 15 minutes on this just to follow traditional best practices
3. Display the articles along with the response
